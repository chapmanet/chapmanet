# About me
### By Ethan
My name is **Ethan**.
<br>I play 
- Guitar
- Piano
- Harmonica<br>

<p>I have created various games in Scratch, and in Code.org, I have created a website about rocket concepts, and I have done some 3D modelling, including keychains and a pool project in maths class.
<br>I am learning to code because I think it's fun and useful.
<br>I can use</p>
<ul>
<li>Scratch
<li>Some HTML
<li>Some CSS
</ul>
<p>I would like to learn more about game development, and luckily that is what we are doing this year in digitech.</p>
